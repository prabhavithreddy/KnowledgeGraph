We are generally more likely to redeem the Notes during periods when we expect that interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate that is greater than that which we would pay on our traditional interest-bearing deposits or debt securities having a maturity equal to the remaining term of the Notes. In contrast, we are generally less likely to redeem the Notes during periods when we expect interest to accrue on the Notes at a rate that is less than that which we would pay on those instruments. If we redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date, accrued interest will be paid on the Notes until such early redemption, but you will not receive any future interest payments from the Notes redeemed, and you may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the redemption in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been redeemed. In addition, our right to redeem the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.\\nRisks Relating to the Issuer\\n●   \\nIssuer Credit Risk—The Notes are our unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, depends on our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event we were to default on our obligations, you may not receive the payment due at maturity or any other amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.\\n●   \\nYou May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, by acquiring the Notes, each holder an',\n",
       " 'nd beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.\\nPS-4\\nRisks Relating to Conflict of Interest\\n●   \\nWe and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.\\nIn connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or produc',\n",
       " 'cts for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to interest rates. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. \\nIn addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.\\nIn addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will make any determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make certain discretionary judgments. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.\\nRisks Relating to the Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market\\n●   \\nCertain Built-In Costs Are Likely to Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity—While the payment at maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full principal amount of your Notes, the original issue price of the Notes includes any Agent’s commission and the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes through one or more of our affiliates. As a result, the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. \\n●   \\nLack of Liquidity—The N',\n",
       " 'Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.\\n●   \\nMany Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:\\no   \\nthe time to maturity of the Notes;\\no   \\ninterest and yield rates in the market generally;\\no   \\ninflation and expectations concerning inflation;\\no   \\na variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; \\no   \\nsupply and demand for the Notes; and\\no   \\nour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.\\nPS-5\\nTAX CONSIDERATIONS\\nYou should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The discussion below applies to you only if you are an initial purchaser of the Notes; if you are a secondary purchaser of the Notes, the tax consequences to you may be different. In the opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the Notes should be treated as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, based on representations provided by us, the Notes should be treated as issued without original issue discount. The remainder of this discussion assumes that this treatment is correct. \\nInterest paid on the Notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it accrues or is received, in accordance with your method of tax accounting. Upon a sale or exchange (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you will generally recognize t',\n",
       " 'taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange (not including any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and your tax basis in the Notes, which will generally equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.\\nThe discussions above and in the accompanying prospectus supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b).\\nNon-U.S. holders. We do not believe that non-U.S. holders should be required to provide a Form W-8 in order to avoid 30% U.S. withholding tax with respect to the interest payments, although the Internal Revenue Service could challenge this position. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.\\nYou should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\\nPS-6\\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\\nWe will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of the related pricing supplement, the document that will be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) containing the final pricing terms of the Notes. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.\\nWe expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on the Original Issue Date, which is more than one business day following the Original Trade Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.\\nP']"

    "Risks Relating to the Notes Generally\n",
    "●   \n",
    "Appropriateness of the Notes for Investment—You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus supplement and the prospectus. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.\n",
    "●   \n",
    "The Notes Will Be Subject to Redemption at Our Option—We may redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date on the dates as indicated on the cover page hereof. If you intend to purchase the Notes, you must be willing to have your Notes redeemed early. We are generally more likely to redeem the Notes during periods when we expect that interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate that is greater than that which we would pay on our traditional interest-bearing deposits or debt securities having a maturity equal to the remaining term of the Notes. In contrast, we are generally less likely to redeem the Notes during periods when we expect interest to accrue on the Notes at a rate that is less than that which we would pay on those instruments. If we redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date, accrued interest will be paid on the Notes until such early redemption, but you will not receive any future interest payments from the Notes redeemed, and you may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the redemption in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been redeemed. In addition, our right to redeem the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.\n",
    "Risks Relating to the Issuer\n",
    "●   \n",
    "Issuer Credit Risk—The Notes are our unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, depends on our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event we were to default on our obligations, you may not receive the payment due at maturity or any other amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.\n",
    "●   \n",
    "You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.\n",
    "PS-4\n",
    "Risks Relating to Conflict of Interest\n",
    "●   \n",
    "We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.\n",
    "In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to interest rates. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. \n",
    "In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.\n",
    "In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will make any determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make certain discretionary judgments. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.\n",
    "Risks Relating to the Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market\n",
    "●   \n",
    "Certain Built-In Costs Are Likely to Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity—While the payment at maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full principal amount of your Notes, the original issue price of the Notes includes any Agent’s commission and the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes through one or more of our affiliates. As a result, the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. \n",
    "●   \n",
    "Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.\n",
    "●   \n",
    "Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:\n",
    "o   \n",
    "the time to maturity of the Notes;\n",
    "o   \n",
    "interest and yield rates in the market generally;\n",
    "o   \n",
    "inflation and expectations concerning inflation;\n",
    "o   \n",
    "a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; \n",
    "o   \n",
    "supply and demand for the Notes; and\n",
    "o   \n",
    "our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.\n",
    "PS-5\n",
    "TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n",
    "You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The discussion below applies to you only if you are an initial purchaser of the Notes; if you are a secondary purchaser of the Notes, the tax consequences to you may be different. In the opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the Notes should be treated as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, based on representations provided by us, the Notes should be treated as issued without original issue discount. The remainder of this discussion assumes that this treatment is correct. \n",
    "Interest paid on the Notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it accrues or is received, in accordance with your method of tax accounting. Upon a sale or exchange (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you will generally recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange (not including any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and your tax basis in the Notes, which will generally equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.\n",
    "The discussions above and in the accompanying prospectus supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b).\n",
    "Non-U.S. holders. We do not believe that non-U.S. holders should be required to provide a Form W-8 in order to avoid 30% U.S. withholding tax with respect to the interest payments, although the Internal Revenue Service could challenge this position. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.\n",
    "You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n",
    "PS-6\n",
    "SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n",
    "We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of the related pricing supplement, the document that will be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) containing the final pricing terms of the Notes. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.\n",
    "We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on the Original Issue Date, which is more than one business day following the Original Trade Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.\n",

      "The Notes Will Be Subject to Redemption at Our Option—We may redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date on the dates as indicated on the cover page hereof. If you intend to purchase the Notes, you must be willing to have your Notes redeemed early. We are generally more likely to redeem the Notes during periods when we expect that interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate that is greater than that which we would pay on our traditional interest-bearing deposits or debt securities having a maturity equal to the remaining term of the Notes. In contrast, we are generally less likely to redeem the Notes during periods when we expect interest to accrue on the Notes at a rate that is less than that which we would pay on those instruments. If we redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date, accrued interest will be paid on the Notes until such early redemption, but you will not receive any future interest payments from the Notes redeemed, and you may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the redemption in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been redeemed. In addition, our right to redeem the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.\n",
      "Risks Relating to the Issuer\n",
      "●   \n",
      "Issuer Credit Risk—The Notes are our unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, depends on our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event we were to default on our obligations, you may not receive the payment due at maturity or any other amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.\n",
      "●   \n",
      "You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.\n",

      "Risks Relating to Conflict of Interest\n",
      "●   \n",
      "We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.\n",
      "In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to interest rates. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. \n",
      "In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.\n",
      "In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will make any determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make certain discretionary judgments. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.\n",
      "Risks Relating to the Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market\n",
      "●   \n",
      "Certain Built-In Costs Are Likely to Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Prior to Maturity—While the payment at maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full principal amount of your Notes, the original issue price of the Notes includes any Agent’s commission and the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes through one or more of our affiliates. As a result, the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. \n",
      "●   \n",
      "Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.\n",
      "●   \n",
      "Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:\n",

      "the time to maturity of the Notes;\n",
      "o   \n",

      "You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The discussion below applies to you only if you are an initial purchaser of the Notes; if you are a secondary purchaser of the Notes, the tax consequences to you may be different. In the opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the Notes should be treated as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, based on representations provided by us, the Notes should be treated as issued without original issue discount. The remainder of this discussion assumes that this treatment is correct. \n",
      "Interest paid on the Notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it accrues or is received, in accordance with your method of tax accounting. Upon a sale or exchange (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you will generally recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange (not including any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) and your tax basis in the Notes, which will generally equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.\n",
      "The discussions above and in the accompanying prospectus supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b).\n",
      "Non-U.S. holders. We do not believe that non-U.S. holders should be required to provide a Form W-8 in order to avoid 30% U.S. withholding tax with respect to the interest payments, although the Internal Revenue Service could challenge this position. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.\n",
      "You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\n",
      "PS-6\n",
      "SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n",
      "We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of the related pricing supplement, the document that will be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) containing the final pricing terms of the Notes. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.\n",
      "We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on the Original Issue Date, which is more than one business day following the Original Trade Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.\n",

    "We have registered the notes on a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange \n",
    "Commission under Registration No. 333-180488. \n",
    "From time to time, we intend to use this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus, and a related \n",
    "product supplement, index supplement and/or pricing supplement to offer the notes. We may refer to any pricing \n",
    "supplement as a “term sheet.” You should read each of these documents before investing in the notes. \n",
    "This prospectus supplement describes additional terms of the notes and supplements the description of our \n",
    "debt securities contained in the accompanying prospectus. If the information in this prospectus supplement is \n",
    "inconsistent with the prospectus, this prospectus supplement will supersede the information in the prospectus. \n",
    "This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus do not constitute an offer to sell or the \n",
    "solicitation of an offer to buy the notes in any jurisdiction in which that offer or solicitation is unlawful. The \n",
    "distribution of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the offering of the notes in some \n",
    "jurisdictions may be restricted by law. If you have received this prospectus supplement and the accompanying \n",
    "prospectus, you should find out about and observe these restrictions. Persons outside the United States who come \n",
    "into possession of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus must inform themselves about and \n",
    "observe any restrictions relating to the distribution of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus \n",
    "and the offering of the notes outside of the United States. See “Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of \n",
    "Interest).” \n",
    "This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus have been prepared on the basis that any offer \n",
    "of notes in any Member State of the European Economic Area (each, a “Relevant Member State”) which has \n",
    "implemented the Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC) (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending \n",
    "Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State, the “Prospectus Directive”) will be made under \n",
    "an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement \n",
    "to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in that \n",
    "Relevant Member State of any notes which are contemplated in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying \n",
    "prospectus may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or any of the selling agents to \n",
    "publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article \n",
    "16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither we nor the selling agents have \n",
    "authorized, and neither we nor they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in which an \n",
    "obligation arises for us or any selling agent to publish or supplement a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus \n",
    "Directive in relation to such offer. Neither this prospectus supplement nor the accompanying prospectus constitutes \n",
    "an approved prospectus for the purposes of the Prospective Directive. \n",
    "For each offering of notes, we will issue a product supplement, index supplement, and/or a pricing supplement \n",
    "which will contain additional terms of the offering and a specific description of the notes being offered. A \n",
    "supplement also may add, update, or change information in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying \n",
    "prospectus, including provisions describing the calculation of the amounts due under the notes and the method of \n",
    "making payments under the terms of a note. We will state in the applicable supplement the interest rate or interest \n",
    "rate basis or formula, issue price, any relevant market measures, the maturity date, interest payment dates, \n",
    "redemption, or repayment provisions, if any, and other relevant terms and conditions for \n",
    "S-3 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "each note at the time of issuance. A supplement also may include a discussion of any risk factors or other special \n",
    "additional considerations that apply to a particular type of note. Each applicable supplement can be quite detailed \n",
    "and always should be read carefully. \n",
    "Any term that is used, but not defined, in this prospectus supplement has the meaning set forth in the \n",
    "accompanying prospectus. \n",
    "S-4 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "RISK FACTORS \n",
    "Your investment in the notes involves significant risks. Your decision to purchase the notes should be made \n",
    "only after carefully considering the risks of an investment in the notes, including those discussed below, in the \n",
    "accompanying prospectus beginning on page 8, and in the relevant supplement(s) for the specific notes, with your \n",
    "advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not \n",
    "knowledgeable about significant elements of the notes or financial matters in general. For information regarding \n",
    "risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business and results, please refer to the information under the \n",
    "captions “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and \n",
    "Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is \n",
    "incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus. You should also review the risk factors that will be set \n",
    "forth in other documents that we will file after the date of this prospectus supplement. \n",
    "The market value of the notes may be less than the principal amount of the notes. \n",
    "The market for, and market value of, the notes may be affected by a number of factors. These factors include: \n",
    "• the method of calculating the principal, premium, if any, interest or other amounts payable, if any, on the \n",
    "notes; \n",
    "• the time remaining to maturity of the notes; \n",
    "• the aggregate amount outstanding of the relevant notes; \n",
    "• any redemption or repayment features of the notes; \n",
    "• the level, direction, and volatility of market interest rates generally; \n",
    "• general economic conditions of the capital markets in the United States; \n",
    "• geopolitical conditions and other financial, political, regulatory, and judicial events that affect the stock \n",
    "markets generally; and \n",
    "• any market-making activities with respect to the notes. \n",
    "Often, the only way to liquidate your investment in the notes prior to maturity will be to sell the notes. At that \n",
    "time, there may be a very illiquid market for the notes or no market at all. For indexed notes that have specific \n",
    "investment objectives or strategies, the applicable market may be more limited, and the price may be more volatile, \n",
    "than for other notes. The market value of indexed notes may be adversely affected by the complexity of the formula \n",
    "and volatility of the applicable reference market measure, including any dividend rates or yields of other securities \n",
    "or financial instruments that relate to the indexed notes. Moreover, the market value of indexed notes could be \n",
    "adversely affected by changes in the amount of outstanding equity or other securities linked to those notes. \n",
    "Holders of indexed notes are subject to important risks that are not associated with more conventional debt \n",
    "securities. \n",
    "If you invest in indexed notes, you will be subject to significant risks not associated with conventional fixed\u0002rate or floating-rate debt securities. These risks include the possibility that the \n",
    "S-5 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "applicable market measures may be subject to fluctuations, and the possibility that you will receive a lower, or no, \n",
    "amount of principal, premium, or interest, and at different times than expected. In recent years, many securities, \n",
    "currencies, commodities, interest rates, indices, and other market measures have experienced volatility, and this \n",
    "volatility may be expected in the future. However, past experience is not necessarily indicative of what may occur in \n",
    "the future. We have no control over a number of factors, including economic, financial, and political events, that are \n",
    "important in determining the existence, magnitude, and longevity of market volatility and other risks and their \n",
    "impact on the value of, or payments made on, the indexed notes. In considering whether to purchase indexed notes, \n",
    "you should be aware that the calculation of amounts payable on indexed notes may involve reference to a market \n",
    "measure determined by one of our affiliates or prices or values that are published solely by third parties or entities \n",
    "which are not regulated by the laws of the United States. Additional risks that you should consider in connection \n",
    "with an investment in indexed notes are set forth in the applicable supplement(s). \n",
    "Our employees who purchase the notes must comply with policies that limit their ability to trade the notes, \n",
    "and that may affect the value of their notes. \n",
    "If you are our employee or an employee of one of our affiliates, including one of the selling agents, you may \n",
    "acquire notes for investment purposes only, and you must comply with all of our internal policies and procedures. \n",
    "Because these policies and procedures limit the dates and times that you may effect a transaction in the notes, you \n",
    "may not be able to purchase any of the notes from us, and your ability to trade or sell any of the notes in any \n",
    "secondary market may be limited. \n",
    "Usury laws may limit the amount of interest that can be charged and paid on the notes. \n",
    "New York law will govern the notes offered by this prospectus supplement. New York usury laws limit the \n",
    "amount of interest that can be charged and paid on loans, including the notes. Under current New York law, the \n",
    "maximum permissible rate of interest is 25% per year on a simple interest basis. This limit may not apply to notes in \n",
    "which $2,500,000 or more has been invested. While we believe that a U.S. federal or state court sitting outside New \n",
    "York may give effect to New York law, many other states also have laws that regulate the amount of interest that \n",
    "may be charged to and paid by a borrower. We do not intend to claim the benefits of any laws concerning usurious \n",
    "rates of interest. \n",
    "DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES \n",
    "This section describes the general terms and conditions of the notes, which may be senior or subordinated \n",
    "medium-term notes. This section supplements, and should be read together with, the general description of our debt \n",
    "securities included in “Description of Debt Securities” in the accompanying prospectus. If there is any inconsistency \n",
    "between the information in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, you should rely on the \n",
    "information in this prospectus supplement. \n",
    "We will describe the particular terms of the notes we sell in a separate supplement. The terms and conditions \n",
    "stated in this section will apply to each note unless the note or the applicable supplement indicates otherwise. \n",
    "General \n",
    "The following summary of the terms of the notes and the indentures is not complete and is qualified in its \n",
    "entirety by reference to the actual notes and the specific provisions of the Senior Indenture and the Subordinated \n",
    "Indenture, as applicable. \n",
    "S-6 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "We will issue the notes as part of a series of debt securities under the Senior Indenture or the Subordinated \n",
    "Indenture, as applicable, which are exhibits to our registration statement and are contracts between us and The Bank \n",
    "of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee. In this prospectus supplement, we refer to The \n",
    "Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as the “trustee,” and we refer to the Senior Indenture and the \n",
    "Subordinated Indenture individually as the “Indenture” and together as the “Indentures.” \n",
    "The Indentures are subject to, and governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. We, the selling agents, and \n",
    "the depository, in the ordinary course of our respective businesses, have conducted and may conduct business with \n",
    "the trustee or its affiliates. See “Description of Debt Securities — The Indentures” in the accompanying prospectus \n",
    "for more information about the Indentures and the functions of the trustee. \n",
    "The notes are our direct unsecured obligations and are not obligations of our subsidiaries. The notes are being \n",
    "offered on a continuous basis. There is no limit under our registration statement on the total initial public offering \n",
    "price or aggregate principal amount of the Senior and Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series L, that may be \n",
    "offered using this prospectus supplement. We may issue other debt securities under the Indentures from time to time \n",
    "in one or more series up to the aggregate principal amount of the then-existing grant of authority by our board of \n",
    "directors. \n",
    "Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplement, the minimum denomination of the notes will be \n",
    "$1,000 and any larger amount that is a whole multiple of $1,000 (or the equivalent in other currencies). We may also \n",
    "issue the notes in units of $10. \n",
    "Types of Notes \n",
    "Fixed-Rate Notes. We may issue notes that bear interest at a fixed rate described in the applicable pricing \n",
    "supplement, which we refer to as “fixed-rate notes.” We also may issue fixed-rate notes that combine principal and \n",
    "interest payments in installment payments over the life of the note, which we refer to as “amortizing notes.” For \n",
    "more information on fixed-rate notes and amortizing notes, see “Description of Debt Securities — Fixed-Rate \n",
    "Notes” in the accompanying prospectus. \n",
    "Floating-Rate Notes. We may issue notes that bear interest at a floating rate of interest determined by \n",
    "reference to one or more base interest rates, or by reference to one or more interest rate formulae, described in the \n",
    "applicable supplement, which we refer to as “floating-rate notes.” In some cases, the interest rate of a floating-rate \n",
    "note also may be adjusted by adding or subtracting a spread or by multiplying the interest rate by a spread multiplier. \n",
    "A floating-rate note also may be subject to a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling, and/or a minimum interest rate \n",
    "limit, or floor, on the interest that may accrue during any interest period. For more information on floating-rate \n",
    "notes, including a description of the manner in which interest payments will be calculated, see “Description of Debt \n",
    "Securities — Floating-Rate Notes” in the accompanying prospectus. \n",
    "Indexed Notes. We may issue notes that provide that the rate of return, including the principal, premium (if \n",
    "any), interest, or other amounts payable (if any), is determined by reference, either directly or indirectly, to the price \n",
    "or performance of one or more securities, commodities, currencies or composite currencies, interest rates, stock or \n",
    "commodity indices, exchange traded funds, currency indices, consumer price indices, inflation indices or other \n",
    "market measures, or any combination of the above, in each case as specified in the applicable supplement. We refer \n",
    "to these notes as “indexed notes.” \n",
    "S-7 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "If you purchase an indexed note, you may receive an amount at maturity that is greater than or less than the \n",
    "face amount of your note, depending upon the formula used to determine the amount payable and the relative value \n",
    "at maturity of the market measure to which your indexed note is linked. We expect that the value of the applicable \n",
    "market measure will fluctuate over time. \n",
    "An indexed note may provide either for cash settlement or for physical settlement by delivery of the relevant \n",
    "asset. An indexed note also may provide that the form of settlement may be determined at our option or the holder’s \n",
    "option. Some indexed notes may be convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable prior to maturity, at our option or the \n",
    "holder’s option, for the relevant asset or the cash value of the relevant asset. \n",
    "We will specify in the applicable supplement the method for determining the principal, premium (if any), \n",
    "interest, or other amounts payable (if any) in respect of particular indexed notes, as well as certain historical or other \n",
    "information with respect to the specified index or other market measure, specific risk factors relating to that \n",
    "particular type of indexed note, and tax considerations associated with an investment in the indexed notes. \n",

    "This section summarizes some specific risks and investment considerations with respect to an investment in \n",
    "our securities. This summary does not describe all of the risks and investment considerations with respect to an \n",
    "investment in our securities, including risks and considerations relating to a prospective investor’s particular \n",
    "circumstances. For information regarding risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business and \n",
    "results, please refer to the information under the captions “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s \n",

    "the risk factors that will be set forth in other documents that we will file after the date of this prospectus, together \n",
    "with the risk factors set forth in any applicable supplement. Prospective investors should consult their own financial, \n",
    "legal, tax, and other professional advisors as to the risks associated with an investment in our securities and the \n",
    "suitability of the investment for the investor. \n",
    "Currency Risks \n",
    "We may issue securities denominated in or whose principal and interest is payable in a currency other than \n",
    "U.S. dollars. We refer to these securities as “Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities.” If you intend to invest in \n",
    "any Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities, you should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the \n",
    "currency risks related to your investment. The Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities are not an appropriate \n",
    "investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about the significant terms and conditions of the Non-U.S. Dollar\u0002Denominated Securities or financial matters in general. The information in this prospectus is directed primarily to \n",
    "investors who are U.S. residents. Investors who are not U.S. residents should consult their own financial and legal \n",
    "advisors about currency-related risks arising from their investment. \n",
    "Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities have significant risks that are not associated with a similar \n",
    "investment in conventional debt securities that are payable solely in U.S. dollars. These risks include possible \n",
    "significant changes in rates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the specified currency and the imposition or \n",
    "modification of foreign exchange controls or other conditions by either the United States or non-U.S. governments. \n",
    "These risks generally are influenced by factors over which we have no control, such as economic and political \n",
    "events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies in the global markets. \n",
    "Currency Exchange Rates. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have been highly \n",
    "volatile. This volatility may continue and could spread to other currencies in the future. Fluctuations in currency \n",
    "exchange rates could affect adversely an investment in the Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities. Depreciation \n",
    "of the specified currency against the U.S. dollar could result in a decrease in the U.S. dollar-equivalent value of \n",
    "payments on the Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities. That in turn could cause the market value of the Non\u0002U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities to fall. \n",
    "Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Except as described below or in a supplement, we will not \n",
    "make any adjustment in or change to the terms of the Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities for changes in the \n",
    "foreign currency exchange rate for the specified currency, including any devaluation, revaluation, or imposition of \n",
    "exchange or other regulatory controls or taxes, or for other developments affecting the specified currency, the U.S. \n",
    "dollar, or any other currency. Consequently, you will bear the risk that your investment may be affected adversely \n",
    "by these types of events. \n",
    "Government Policy. Foreign currency exchange rates either can float or be fixed by sovereign governments. \n",
    "Governments or governmental bodies, including the European Central \n",
    "8 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "Bank, may intervene in their economies to alter the exchange rate or exchange characteristics of their currencies. For \n",
    "example, a central bank may intervene to devalue or revalue a currency or to replace an existing currency. In \n",
    "addition, a government may impose regulatory controls or taxes to affect the exchange rate of its currency. As a \n",
    "result, the yield or payout of a Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Security could be affected significantly and \n",
    "unpredictably by governmental actions. Changes in exchange rates could affect the value of the Non-U.S. Dollar\u0002Denominated Securities as participants in the global currency markets move to buy or sell the specified currency or \n",
    "U.S. dollars in reaction to these developments. \n",
    "If a governmental authority imposes exchange controls or other conditions, such as taxes on the transfer of the \n",
    "specified currency, there may be limited availability of the specified currency for payment on the Non-U.S. Dollar\u0002Denominated Securities at their maturity or on any other payment date. In addition, the ability of a holder to move \n",
    "currency freely out of the country in which payment in the currency is received or to convert the currency at a freely \n",
    "determined market rate could be limited by governmental actions. \n",
    "Payments in U.S. Dollars. The terms of any Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities may provide that we \n",
    "may have the right to make a payment in U.S. dollars instead of the specified currency, if at or about the time when \n",
    "the payment on the Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities comes due, the specified currency is subject to \n",
    "convertibility, transferability, market disruption, or other conditions affecting its availability because of \n",
    "circumstances beyond our control. These circumstances could include the imposition of exchange controls or our \n",
    "inability to obtain the specified currency because of a disruption in the currency markets for the specified currency. \n",
    "The exchange rate used to make payment in U.S. dollars may be based on limited information and would involve \n",
    "significant discretion on the part of our exchange rate agent. As a result, the value of the payment in U.S. dollars \n",
    "may be less than the value of the payment you would have received in the specified currency if the specified \n",
    "currency had been available. The exchange rate agent will generally not have any liability for its determinations. \n",
    "Court Judgments. Any Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities typically will be governed by New York \n",
    "law. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment \n",
    "on the Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities would be required to render the judgment in the specified \n",
    "currency. In turn, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of \n",
    "entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities, you \n",
    "would bear currency exchange risk until judgment is entered, which could be a long time. \n",
    "In courts outside of New York, you may not be able to obtain judgment in a specified currency other than U.S. \n",
    "dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated Securities in many \n",
    "other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date \n",
    "used to determine the rate of conversion of the specified currency into U.S. dollars will depend on various factors, \n",
    "including which court renders the judgment. \n",
    "Information About Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. If we issue a Non-U.S. Dollar-Denominated \n",

    "The Indentures \n",
    "The senior debt securities and the subordinated debt securities each are governed by a document called an \n",
    "indenture, which is a contract between us and the applicable trustee. Senior debt securities will be issued under the \n",
    "Indenture dated as of January 1, 1995 (as supplemented, the “Senior Indenture”) between us and The Bank of New \n",
    "York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee, and subordinated debt securities will be issued under the \n",

    "• the covenant described below under “—Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock of Banks,” which is included only \n",
    "in the Senior Indenture; \n",
    "• the provisions relating to subordination described below under “—Subordination,” which are included only \n",
    "in the Subordinated Indenture; and \n",
    "• the events of default described below under “—Events of Default and Rights of Acceleration,” many of \n",
    "which are not included in the Subordinated Indenture. \n",
    "In this prospectus, when we refer to “debt securities,” we mean both our senior debt securities and our \n",
    "subordinated debt securities, and when we refer to the “indenture” or the “trustee” with respect to any debt \n",
    "securities, we mean the indenture under which those debt securities are issued and the trustee under that indenture. \n",
    "The trustee under each indenture has two principal functions: \n",
    "• First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default. However, there are limitations on the \n",
    "extent to which the trustee may act on your behalf, which we describe below under “—Collection of \n",
    "Indebtedness.” \n",
    "• Second, the trustee performs administrative duties for us, including the delivery of interest payments and \n",

    "Form and Denomination of Debt Securities \n",
    "Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each debt security in global, or book\u0002entry, form. Debt securities in book-entry form will be represented by a global security registered in the name of a \n",
    "depository. Accordingly, the depository will be the holder of all the debt securities represented by the global \n",
    "security. Those who own beneficial interests in a global security will do so through participants in the depository’s \n",

    "Generally, all securities represented by the same global security will have the same terms. We may, however, \n",

    "whether your debt securities are represented by a master global security. \n",
    "Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue our debt securities in fully registered \n",
    "form, without coupons. If we issue a debt security in bearer form, we will describe the special considerations \n",

    "Fixed-Rate Notes \n",
    "General. We may issue debt securities that bear interest at one or more fixed rates of interest, as specified in \n",
    "the applicable supplement. We refer to these as “fixed-rate notes.” Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable \n",
    "supplement, each fixed-rate note will bear interest from its original issue date or from the most recent date to which \n",
    "interest on the note has been paid or made available for payment. Interest will accrue on the principal of a fixed-rate \n",
    "note at the fixed annual rate stated in the applicable supplement, until the principal is paid or made available for \n",
    "payment or the note is converted or exchanged. \n",
    "Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will pay interest on any fixed-rate note \n",
    "quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, as applicable, in arrears, on the days set forth in the applicable supplement \n",
    "(each such day being an “interest payment date”) and at maturity. Each interest payment due on an interest payment \n",

    "which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the original issue date, to but excluding the next \n",
    "interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable \n",
    "supplement, interest on fixed-rate notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of \n",
    "twelve 30-day months. We will make payments on fixed-rate notes as described below under the heading “—\n",
    "Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Due.” \n",
    "Amortizing Notes. We also may issue amortizing notes, which are fixed-rate notes for which combined \n",
    "principal and interest payments are made in installments over the life of the debt security. Payments on amortizing \n",

    "Floating-Rate Notes \n",

    "• any other interest rate formula as may be specified in the applicable supplement. \n",
    "The interest rate for a floating-rate note will be determined by reference to: \n",
    "• the specified base rate based on the index maturity; \n",
    "• plus or minus the spread, if any; and/or \n",
    "• multiplied by the spread multiplier, if any. \n",
    "For any floating-rate note, the “index maturity” is the period to maturity of the instrument for which the \n",
    "interest rate basis is calculated and will be specified in the applicable supplement. The “spread” is the number of \n",
    "basis points we specify on the floating-rate note to be added to or subtracted from the base rate. The “spread \n",
    "multiplier” is the percentage we may specify on the floating-rate note by which the base rate is multiplied in order to \n",
    "calculate the applicable interest rate. \n",
    "A floating-rate note also may be subject to: \n",
    "• a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling, on the interest that may accrue during any interest period; \n",
    "• a minimum interest rate limit, or floor, on the interest that may accrue during any interest period; or \n",
    "• both. \n",
    "Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each floating-rate note will bear interest from its \n",
    "original issue date or from the most recent date to which interest on the note has been paid or made available for \n",
    "payment. Interest will accrue on the principal of a floating-rate note at the annual rate determined according to the \n",

    "depositary share will be entitled, in proportion to the fractional interest of a share of preferred stock represented by \n",
    "the applicable depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the preferred stock being represented, including \n",
    "dividend, voting, redemption, conversion, and liquidation rights, all as will be set forth in the applicable supplement \n",
    "relating to the depositary shares being offered. \n",
    "Pending the preparation of definitive depositary receipts, the depository, upon our written order, may issue \n",
    "temporary depositary receipts. The temporary depositary receipts will be substantially identical to, and will have all \n",
    "the rights of, the definitive depositary receipts, but will not be in definitive form. Definitive depositary receipts will \n",
    "be prepared thereafter and temporary depositary receipts will be exchanged for definitive depositary receipts at our \n",

    "Withdrawal of Preferred Stock \n",
    "Unless the depositary shares have been called for redemption, a holder of depositary shares may surrender his \n",
    "or her depositary receipts at the principal office of the depository, pay any charges, and comply with any other terms \n",
    "as provided in the deposit agreement for the number of shares of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares. A \n",
    "holder of depositary shares who withdraws shares of preferred stock will be entitled to receive whole shares of \n",
    "preferred stock on the basis set forth in the applicable supplement relating to the depositary shares being offered. \n",
    "However, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, holders of whole shares of preferred \n",
    "stock will not be entitled to deposit those shares under the deposit agreement or to receive depositary receipts for \n",
    "those shares after the withdrawal. If the depositary shares surrendered by the holder in connection with the \n",

    "the net proceeds to the holders of the depositary shares. \n",
    "Redemption of Depositary Shares \n",
    "If a series of preferred stock which relates to depositary shares is redeemed, the depositary shares will be \n",
    "redeemed from the proceeds received by the depository from the redemption, in whole or in part, of that series of \n",
    "preferred stock. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the depository will mail notice of \n",
    "redemption at least 30 and not more than 45 calendar days before the date fixed for redemption to the record holders \n",
    "of the depositary shares to be redeemed at their addresses appearing in the depository’s books. The redemption price \n",
    "per depositary share will be equal to the applicable fraction of the redemption price per share payable on that series \n",
    "of the preferred stock. \n",
    "Whenever we redeem preferred stock held by the depository, the depository will redeem as of the same \n",
    "redemption date the number of depositary shares representing the preferred stock redeemed. If less than all of the \n",
    "depositary shares are redeemed, the depositary shares redeemed will be selected by lot or pro rata or by any other \n",
    "equitable method as the depository may decide. \n",
    "After the date fixed for redemption, the depositary shares called for redemption will no longer be deemed to \n",

    "any money or other property they become entitled to receive upon surrender to the depository of the depositary \n",
    "receipts. \n",
    "Voting the Deposited Preferred Stock \n",
    "Any voting rights of holders of the depositary shares are directly dependent on the voting rights of the \n",
    "underlying preferred stock, which customarily have limited voting rights. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at \n",
    "which the holders of the preferred stock held by the depository are entitled to vote, the depository will mail the \n",
    "information contained in the notice of meeting to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the preferred \n",
    "stock. Each record holder of depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for \n",
    "the preferred stock, will be entitled to instruct the depository as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the \n",
    "amount of preferred stock underlying the holder’s depositary shares. The depository will endeavor, insofar as \n",
    "practicable, to vote the amount of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares in accordance with these \n",
    "instructions. We will agree to take all action which may be deemed necessary by the depository to enable the \n",

    "Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement \n",
    "The form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit agreement \n",

    "51 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "shares will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the record holders of at least a majority of \n",

    "existence of the depository arrangements. We will pay the fees of the depository in connection with the initial \n",
    "deposit of the preferred stock and any redemption of the preferred stock. Holders of depositary receipts will pay \n",
    "transfer and other taxes, assessments, and governmental charges and any other charges as are expressly provided in \n",
    "the deposit agreement to be for their accounts. The depository may refuse to effect any transfer of a depositary \n",

    "presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of depositary shares, or other persons believed to be competent and \n",
    "on documents believed to be genuine. \n",
    "Resignation and Removal of Depository \n",
    "The depository may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so, and we may remove \n",
    "the depository at any time. Any resignation or removal will take effect only upon the appointment of a successor \n",

    "common stock incorporated by reference in this prospectus. \n",
    "General \n",
    "As of the date of this prospectus, under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we are \n",
    "authorized to issue twelve billion eight hundred million (12,800,000,000) shares of common \n",
    "52 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "stock, par value $.01 per share, of which approximately 10.77 billion shares were outstanding on March 15, 2012. \n",
    "Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BAC.” Our common stock also is \n",
    "listed on the London Stock Exchange, and certain shares are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. As of March 15, \n",
    "2012, approximately 1.91 billion shares were reserved for issuance in connection with our various employee and \n",
    "director benefit plans, the conversion of outstanding securities convertible into shares of our common stock, and for \n",
    "other purposes. After taking into account the reserved shares, there were approximately 114 million authorized \n",
    "shares of our common stock available for issuance as of March 15, 2012. \n",
    "Voting and Other Rights \n",
    "Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. There are no cumulative voting rights. In \n",
    "general, a majority of votes cast on a matter is sufficient to take action upon routine matters, including the election \n",
    "of directors in an uncontested election. However, (1) amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of \n",
    "Incorporation generally must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of \n",
    "the outstanding stock, and (2) a merger, dissolution, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets generally must \n",
    "be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock. \n",
    "In the event of our liquidation, holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata any assets \n",
    "legally available for distribution to stockholders, subject to any prior rights of any preferred stock then outstanding. \n",
    "Our common stock does not have any preemptive rights, redemption privileges, sinking fund privileges, or \n",
    "conversion rights. All the outstanding shares of our common stock are, and upon proper conversion of any \n",
    "convertible securities, all of the shares of our common stock into which those securities are converted will be, \n",
    "validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. \n",
    "Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock. \n",
    "Dividends \n",
    "Subject to the preferential rights of any holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of our \n",
    "common stock are entitled to receive dividends or distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as our board \n",
    "of directors may declare out of funds legally available for payments. Stock dividends, if any are declared, may be \n",

    "REGISTRATION AND SETTLEMENT \n",
    "Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue the securities in registered, and not \n",
    "bearer, form. This means that our obligation runs to the holder of the security named on the face of the security. \n",
    "Each debt security, warrant, purchase contract, unit, share of preferred stock, and depositary share issued in \n",
    "registered form will be represented either by a certificate issued in definitive form to a particular investor or by one \n",
    "or more global securities representing the entire issuance of securities. \n",
    "We refer to those persons who have securities registered in their own names, on the books that we or the \n",
    "trustee, warrant agent, or other agent maintain for this purpose, as the “holders” of those securities. These persons \n",
    "are the legal holders of the securities. We refer to those who, indirectly through others, own beneficial interests in \n",
    "securities that are not registered in their own names as indirect owners of those securities. As we discuss below, \n",
    "indirect owners are not legal holders, and investors in securities issued in global, or book-entry, form or in street \n",
    "name will be indirect owners. \n",
    "Book-Entry Only Issuance \n",
    "Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each security other than our common \n",
    "stock in global, or book-entry, form. This means that we will not issue actual notes or certificates to investors. \n",
    "Instead, we will issue global securities in registered form representing the entire issuance of securities. Each global \n",
    "security will be registered in the name of a financial institution or clearing system that holds the global security as \n",
    "depository on behalf of other financial institutions that participate in that depository’s book-entry system. These \n",
    "participating institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the global securities on behalf of themselves or their \n",
    "customers. \n",
    "Because securities issued in global form are registered in the name of the depository, we will recognize only \n",
    "the depository as the holder of the securities. This means that we will make all payments on the securities, including \n",
    "deliveries of any property other than cash, to the depository. The depository passes along the payments it receives \n",
    "from us to its participants, which in turn pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial owners. \n",
    "The depository and its participants are not obligated to pass these payments along under the terms of the securities. \n",
    "Instead, they do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers. \n",
    "As a result, investors will not own securities issued in book-entry form directly. Instead, they will own \n",
    "beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker, or other financial institution that participates in the \n",
    "depository’s book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant in the depository’s book-entry system. As \n",
    "long as the securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect owners, and not holders, of the securities. \n",
    "The depository will not have knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities. \n",
    "Certificates in Registered Form \n",
    "In the future, we may cancel a global security or we may issue securities initially in non-global, or certificated, \n",
    "form. We do not expect to exchange global securities for actual notes or certificates registered in the names of the \n",
    "beneficial owners of the global securities representing the securities unless: \n",
    "• the depository notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the global securities, or \n",
    "we become aware that the depository has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities \n",
    "Exchange Act of 1934, and in any case we fail to appoint a successor to the depository within 60 calendar \n",
    "days; or \n",
    "54 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "• we, in our sole discretion, determine that the global securities will be exchangeable for certificated \n",
    "securities. \n",
    "Street Name Owners \n",
    "When we issue actual notes or certificates registered in the names of the beneficial owners, investors may \n",
    "choose to hold their securities in their own names or in street name. Securities held by an investor in street name \n",
    "would be registered in the name of a bank, broker, or other financial institution that the investor chooses, and the \n",
    "investor would hold only a beneficial interest in those securities through an account that he or she maintains at that \n",
    "institution. \n",
    "For securities held in street name, we will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers, and other financial \n",
    "institutions in whose names the securities are registered as the holders of those securities, and we will make all \n",
    "payments on those securities, including deliveries of any property other than cash, to them. These institutions pass \n",
    "along the payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do \n",
    "so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold securities in street \n",
    "name will be indirect owners, not holders, of those securities. \n",
    "Legal Holders \n",
    "Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the trustee under any indenture and the obligations, if any, of any \n",
    "warrant agents, unit agents, depository for depositary shares, and any other third parties employed by us, the trustee, \n",
    "or any of those agents, run only to the holders of the securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold \n",
    "beneficial interests in global securities, who hold the securities in street name, or who hold the securities by any \n",
    "other indirect means. This will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect owner of a security or has \n",
    "no choice because we are issuing the securities only in global form. For example, once we make a payment or give a \n",
    "notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for that payment or notice even if that holder is required, \n",
    "under agreements with depository participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect owners, but \n",
    "does not do so. Similarly, if we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose, such as to amend the \n",
    "indenture for a series of debt securities or the warrant agreement for a series of warrants or the unit agreement for a \n",
    "series of units or to relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular \n",
    "provision of an indenture, we would seek the approval only from the holders, and not the indirect owners, of the \n",
    "relevant securities. Whether and how the holders contact the indirect owners is up to the holders. \n",
    "When we refer to “you” in this prospectus, we mean those who invest in the securities being offered by this \n",
    "prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect owners of those securities. When we refer to “your \n",
    "securities” in this prospectus, we mean the securities in which you will hold a direct or indirect interest. \n",
    "Special Considerations for Indirect Owners \n",
    "If you hold securities through a bank, broker, or other financial institution, either in book-entry form or in \n",
    "street name, you should check with your own institution to find out: \n",
    "• how it handles payments on your securities and notices; \n",
    "• whether you can provide contact information to the registrar to receive copies of notices directly; \n",
    "55 \n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    "• whether it imposes fees or charges; \n",
    "• whether and how you can instruct it to exercise any rights to purchase or sell warrant property under a \n",
    "warrant or purchase contract property under a purchase contract or to exchange or convert a security for or \n",
    "into other property; \n",
    "• how it would handle a request for the holders’ consent, if required; \n",
    "• whether and how you can instruct it to send you the securities registered in your own name so you can be a \n",
    "holder, if that is permitted at any time; \n",
    "• how it would exercise rights under the securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for \n",
    "holders to act to protect their interests; and \n",
    "• if the securities are in book-entry form, how the depository’s rules and procedures will affect these matters. \n",
    "Depositories for Global Securities \n",
    "Each security issued in book-entry form will be represented by a global security that we deposit with and \n",
    "register in the name of one or more financial institutions or clearing systems, or their nominees, which we will \n",
    "select. A financial institution or clearing system that we select for this purpose is called the “depository” for that \n",
    "security. A security usually will have only one depository, but it may have more. \n",
    "Each series of securities will have one or more of the following as the depositories: \n",
    "• The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, which is known as “DTC”; \n",
    "• a financial institution holding the securities on behalf of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, which is known as \n",
    "“Euroclear”; \n",
    "• a financial institution holding the securities on behalf of Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, \n",
    "Luxembourg, which is known as “Clearstream, Luxembourg”; and \n",
    "• any other clearing system or financial institution that we identify in the applicable supplement. \n",
    "The depositories named above also may be participants in one another’s clearing systems. For example, if \n",
    "DTC is the depository for a global security, investors may hold beneficial interests in that security through Euroclear \n",
    "or Clearstream, Luxembourg as DTC participants. \n",
    "We will name the depository or depositories for your securities in the applicable supplement. If no depository \n",
